Census Visualization Practice
=============================

For this learning assignment, I made some visualizations with Matplotlib and Plotly to initially explore U.S. Census business data
publish in 2019.

Since the Census collected a daunting amount of demographic data for businesses during this period, I decided to look at a few aspects
of gender demographics in the American workplace.

First, I looked at Annual Payroll per business sector for employees of all genders.

Next, I looked at employment numbers for women by business sector.

Finally, I looked at gender-equal firms broken down by business sector.

These visualizations can be viewed in the CensusVisual.ipynb
